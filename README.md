# Front-end-Frameworks
As part of my frontend learning journey, this project focuses on using front-end frameworks like Bulma, UIKit, or Bootstrap to build a responsive card component and grid layout.
What I built:
A responsive card component with an image and some text using Bulma or UIKit.
A basic responsive grid layout using a framework like Bootstrap or Foundation to understand how layout systems work.
What I learned:
How to use classes from front-end frameworks to style components quickly.
How responsive design works without writing custom CSS.
The basics of layout systems like grids, columns, and containers.
This task helped me get comfortable using popular CSS frameworks to speed up development and build cleaner, mobile-friendly interfaces.
